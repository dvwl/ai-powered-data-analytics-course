# Module 4: AI-Powered Data Analytics

## Overview

Welcome to the future of data analytics! In this module, we'll learn how to leverage AI assistants like ChatGPT, Claude, and GitHub Copilot to accelerate our data analysis workflows. We'll explore how AI can help with data cleaning, analysis, visualization, and insight generation while maintaining analytical rigor and ethical standards.

## Datasets

**Sources:**
- [`retail-sales-dataset.csv`](../data/retail-sales-dataset.csv) - E-commerce sales data with quality issues
- [`customer-demographics.csv`](../data/customer-demographics.csv) - Customer information with missing values  
- [`product-catalog.csv`](../data/product-catalog.csv) - Product details and categories

> Note: These datasets contain intentional data quality issues for AI-assisted cleaning practice.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+ with pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly
- OpenAI API key or Azure OpenAI access
- Basic understanding of data analysis concepts from Modules 1-3
